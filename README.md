## Textual Adversarial Sample
- Repairing Adversarial Texts through Perturbation; Guoliang Dong, Jingyi Wang, Jun Sun, Sudipta Chattopadhyay, Xinyu Wang, Ting Dai, Jie Shi and Jin Song Dong; Introduce method to detect textual adversarial samples and "repair" them. 




## Security




## Backdoor Learning
- Rethink Stealthy Backdoor Attacks in Natural Language Processing; Lingfeng Shen, Haiyun Jiang, Lemao Liu, Shuming Shi; Results in Table 1 are a little bit weird. But present an intersting idea, measuring what acturally contribute to the high ASR of backdoor attack (e.g. trigger? mislabel? et al).
