## Textual Adversarial Sample
- **Repairing Adversarial Texts through Perturbation;** Guoliang Dong, Jingyi Wang, Jun Sun, Sudipta Chattopadhyay, Xinyu Wang, Ting Dai, Jie Shi and Jin Song Dong; Introduce method to detect textual adversarial samples and "repair" them. 






## Trustworthy (broad topic)
- **Explaining Prediction Uncertainty of Pre-trained Language Models by Detecting Uncertain Words in Inputs; (Uncertainty)** Hanjie Chen, Yangfeng Ji 
- **Calibration of Pre-trained Transformers; (Unvertainty)** Shrey Desai, Greg Durrett; Empirically study the calibration of PLMs, in both in-domain & out-out-domain. Also include label smoothing and temperature scaling in the experiments. 
- **Calibrated Language Model Fine-Tuning for In- and Out-of-Distribution Data; (Uncertainty)** Lingkai Kong, Haoming Jiang, Yuchen Zhuang, Jie Lyu, Tuo Zhao, Chao Zhang
- **Types of Out-of-Distribution Texts and How to Detect Them; (OOD detection)** Udit Arora, William Huang and He He; Analyze two types of ood data and benchmark two popular ood detection methods, get some interesting findings. 
- **On the Trade-off between Adversarial and Backdoor Robustness;** Cheng-Hsin Weng, Yan-Ting Lee, Shan-Hung Wu




## Backdoor Learning
- **Rethink Stealthy Backdoor Attacks in Natural Language Processing;** Lingfeng Shen, Haiyun Jiang, Lemao Liu, Shuming Shi; Results in Table 1 are a little bit weird. But present an intersting idea, measuring what acturally contributes to the high ASR of backdoor attack (e.g. trigger? mislabel? et al). Also, propose two effective methods to defend against stealthy backdoor attack. 


## Interesting Topics
- **Advancing mathematics by guiding human intuition with AI;** Alex Davies et al
